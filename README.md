## Description

This project is about manipulating the DOM with JavaScript.

## Credits
In the `app.js` file there is a function `isInViewport` that checks whether a given element is within the visible viewport. This function is not the author of this repository's own work, as it is taken from [https://www.javascripttutorial.net/dom/css/check-if-an-element-is-visible-in-the-viewport/](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/dom/css/check-if-an-element-is-visible-in-the-viewport/). Any own solution built on top of the knowledge gained from reading this site would have been so similar to the solution found on this page that it would have looked like been taken and adopted from this solution without giving credits.

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality
